# Sonar
Explore the ocean, collect items and top your personal bests in Sonar! First, try Explore mode, where you move your finger around the screen, using cues from sound, colour and the distance sensor to try to find hidden items. Then, try Broken Sonar mode, which adds extra challenge by making you unable to use some sensors. Collect more items to unlock new modes and harder difficulties!

This is the second game I made, created with Pythonista for iOS sometime around 2015. In February 2019, I modified the code to be more efficient and work on screens of any size.
